# Water, Technology & Future — Manifesto 🌍

A public reflection on the use of **Earth’s finite resources**, especially **water**, to power machines designed to reduce human effort.

This manifesto calls for ecological and ethical awareness in the use of technology — balancing comfort with planetary responsibility.

## 💡 Purpose

> “Do we have ethical legitimacy to consume the planet’s finite resources — especially water — to power machines that reduce human effort?”

The manifesto proposes three guiding principles:

1. **Prioritize Life:** Vital resources should be used to ensure both human and ecological needs.
2. **Efficiency & Circularity:** Technology should reduce total resource consumption, not increase it.
3. **Intergenerational Justice:** Technological decisions must consider future generations, not just immediate gains.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Technology itself is not the problem — but **how** and **why** we use it. It should serve to relieve human suffering and restore ecological balance, not merely sustain an unsustainable lifestyle.

> “There is no progress if the cost is the foundation of life itself.”
